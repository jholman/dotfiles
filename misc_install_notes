Wanna use postgres?  After installing, remember to
  * create a role in the DB for myself, probably like this:
        `sudo su postgres -c 'createuser jholman --superuser' `
  * optionally create a self-named DB to make `psql` easier
	`createdb jholman`
  * fiddle with pg_hba.conf as necessary
    * maybe add "local all all trust" if you wanna let all users log in as anyone (via unix sockets)
    * but then again, it already has "local all all peer", which is enough for jholman to log in as jholman
